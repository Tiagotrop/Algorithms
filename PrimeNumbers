Input:
    var Number 
    var Diviser
    var Reminder
Error test
  number = 3
  divisor = 2
  reminder = 
Process:
    Process
If (number < 2)
	print “its not prime!”
	number += 1
	process again
If (number = 2)
	print “number is prime”
	number += 1
If (number > 2)
	run the  next process 
remainder = number % divisor
If (remainder = 0)
	It is not prime number, number +=1, divisor = 2, process again 
Else 
	divisor +=1
	if ( number = divisor)
		print “number is prime”, number +=1, divisor = 2, 	process again
	else
		process again
  if Number > 100
    stop the process
Output:
Print the Prime numbers
1= NP
2 = P
3 = P
4 = NP
5 = P
